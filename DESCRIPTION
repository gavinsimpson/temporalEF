Description: Build sets of (asymmetric) one-dimensional, temporal
    eigenfunctions. The set of eigenfunctions are orthogonal patterns of
    temporal variation at a range of scales. Two types of temporal
    eigenfunctions are implemented; i) asymmetric temporal eigenfunctions
    (ATEs), based on the Asymmetric Eigenvector Map (AEM) method of Blanchet et
    al (2008), and ii) principal coordinates of temporal neighbour matrices
    (PCTNs), based on the concept of principal coordinates of neighboour
    matrices.
