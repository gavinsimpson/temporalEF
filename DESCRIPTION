Description: Build sets of (asymmetric) one-dimensional, temporal eigenfunctions. The set of
    eigenfunctions are orthogonal patterns of temporal variation at a range of scales. Two types
    of temporal eigenfunctions are implemented; i) asymmetric temporal eigenfunctions (ATEs),
    based on the Asymmetric Eigenvector Map (AEM) method of Blanchet et al (2008), and ii)
    principal coordinates of temporal neighbour matrices (PCTNs), based on the concept of
    principal coordinates of neighbour matrices.
